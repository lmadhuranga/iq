Perfect ✅
Here is your **TypeScript skill extraction**, based strictly on our conversations inside the Madhuranga project (practice signals + architecture discussions — not CV-based).

---

# 🧠 TypeScript Skill Set (Conversation-Derived)

This reflects:

* React + TS usage
* Redux with TS
* Backend discussions (NestJS context)
* Interview preparation depth
* Architecture-level thinking

---

# 1️⃣ Core TypeScript Fundamentals

```
Basic Type Annotations
Interface usage (implicit via React patterns)
Type inference understanding
Typed function parameters
Return type awareness
Type-safe state handling
```

You consistently referenced:

* TypeScript in React projects
* Typed Redux flow
* Strong typing in APIs

---

# 2️⃣ React + TypeScript Patterns

Based on discussions around:

* useRef explanation
* Redux flow
* Component architecture

You show awareness of:

```
Typing React functional components
Typing props
Typing state
Typing Redux actions
Typed dispatch patterns
Type-safe component architecture
```

This indicates:
→ Practical TS usage in UI layer

---

# 3️⃣ Backend TypeScript Awareness (NestJS Context)

From backend architecture conversations:

```
DTO-based typing mindset
Structured API contracts
Type-driven REST API design
Class-based backend structure
Decorator-based architecture (NestJS awareness)
```

Even though not deeply coded here, your system discussions imply:

→ Strong structural typing mindset

---

# 4️⃣ Architecture-Level Type Thinking

Your AI / Agent memory discussions show:

```
Schema-based thinking
JSON structure modeling
Type-safe data modeling
Structured configuration design
Skill taxonomy modeling
```

This is advanced conceptual TypeScript thinking.

---

# 5️⃣ Strong Signals

You think in:

* Structured data contracts
* Typed architecture boundaries
* Controlled data flow
* Predictable state modeling

That is very TypeScript-aligned thinking.
