# 🧠 Performance Engineering Skill Extraction

(Conversation-Derived)

This domain is strongly visible in your rendering, throttle, SSR, and architecture discussions.

---

# 1️⃣ Frontend Performance Awareness

From React + rendering discussions:

```
Re-render trigger awareness
Virtual DOM diffing understanding
Reconciliation performance impact
State update cost awareness
Component optimization mindset
```

You clearly think about:

“What causes re-render?”
“How to prevent unnecessary updates?”

That is performance-level thinking.

---

# 2️⃣ Time-Based Execution Control

From throttle implementation:

```
Throttle pattern implementation
Execution frequency control
Time-based state control
UI event optimization
Function rate limiting
```

This is applied performance optimization logic.

---

# 3️⃣ Rendering Strategy Optimization

From SSR / CSR / SSG discussions:

```
SSR vs CSR trade-off analysis
SSG benefits awareness
SEO-driven rendering strategy
Lighthouse optimization mindset
Initial load performance awareness
```

You understand rendering is an architectural decision.

---

# 4️⃣ Backend Performance Thinking

From system design discussions:

```
Async workload separation
Event-driven decoupling
Non-blocking architecture awareness
Scalable API design thinking
```

You implicitly reason about performance at system scale.

---

# 5️⃣ Optimization Strategy Mindset

Across conversations:

```
Bottleneck awareness
Efficiency-first reasoning
Trade-off evaluation
System-level performance modeling
```

You don't think just in features.
You think in cost.
