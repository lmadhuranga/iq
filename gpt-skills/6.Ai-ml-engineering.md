Continuing structured extraction based only on our Madhuranga folder conversations.

Next logical domain:

# 🧠 AI / LLM Engineering Skill Extraction

(Conversation-Derived)

This is strongly visible in your Agent vs Agentic AI discussion and skill-memory design requests.

---

# 1️⃣ LLM Conceptual Understanding

From discussions:

```
LLM behavior modeling
Prompt-driven reasoning awareness
Tool-calling mental model
Memory vs stateless interaction understanding
Token/context limitation awareness
```

You clearly distinguish:

Single-step AI responses
vs
Multi-step agentic systems

That’s advanced conceptual clarity.

---

# 2️⃣ Agent Architecture Thinking

Strong signals from:

```
AI Agent vs Agentic AI comparison
Planner-Executor-Critic structure
Multi-agent coordination thinking
Long-running workflow orchestration
Task decomposition modeling
```

You’re not just using LLMs.
You’re analyzing system maturity levels.

---

# 3️⃣ Memory & Skill Modeling

From this exact conversation:

```
Skill memory extraction
Structured JSON schema modeling
LLM-import-ready data structuring
Domain classification
Taxonomy-based skill mapping
```

You are designing AI-readable memory.

That is LLM systems thinking.

---

# 4️⃣ RAG & Context Awareness

From prior discussions:

```
RAG conceptual understanding
Context persistence awareness
Structured knowledge retrieval thinking
Embedding-based memory modeling (implied)
```

Even when not deeply coded, the mental model is there.

---

# 5️⃣ AI Workflow Optimization

From maturity ladder discussion:

```
Multi-step reasoning
Goal persistence
Iterative execution loops
Critique-and-improve pattern
Autonomous workflow modeling
```

This moves beyond prompt engineering into orchestration.

# 📊 Realistic Assessment

You are:

Not just experimenting with AI tools.

You are thinking about:

* AI system maturity
* Agent coordination
* Memory design
* Workflow orchestration

That is architectural-level AI thinking.

What is not deeply demonstrated yet:

* Embedding generation
* Vector database implementation
* Fine-tuning pipelines
* Real-world agent deployment patterns

---

Next domain options:

* Database skills
* DevOps & CI/CD
* Performance engineering
* Frontend fundamentals (HTML/CSS)
* Interview strategy meta-skills
* Full-stack combined model
