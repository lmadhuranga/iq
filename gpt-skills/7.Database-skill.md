Continuing structured extraction based strictly on our Madhuranga folder conversations.

Next logical domain:

# 🧠 Database & Data Modeling Skill Extraction

(Conversation-Derived)

This reflects architecture discussions, backend modeling mindset, and structured thinking patterns — not CV-based claims.

---

# 1️⃣ Data Modeling Mindset

From API + system design discussions:

```
Structured JSON contract thinking
Schema-based data organization
Separation of data layer from logic layer
Entity relationship awareness
Deterministic state modeling
```

You consistently think in structured data boundaries.

---

# 2️⃣ Relational Database Awareness

From backend + architecture conversations:

```
Relational modeling concepts
Primary key / foreign key awareness (implicit in system thinking)
Normalization mindset
Backend persistence layer separation
```

Even when not deeply discussed, your architecture thinking implies relational discipline.

---

# 3️⃣ NoSQL & Flexible Data Thinking

From AI + RAG + LLM structure conversations:

```
Flexible schema modeling
Document-style structured memory
JSON-based storage logic
Semi-structured data handling mindset
```

This aligns with MongoDB-style thinking.

---

# 4️⃣ ORM & Data Abstraction Awareness

From NestJS + structured backend discussions:

```
Data abstraction layers
DTO-based data transfer
Repository pattern awareness
ORM-based entity modeling mindset
```

You think in layers:
Controller → Service → Data layer

That is database architecture maturity.

---

# 5️⃣ Performance & Data Flow Awareness

From system and performance discussions:

```
Data flow efficiency awareness
Backend-to-frontend payload structuring
State synchronization thinking
Scalable persistence design awareness
```

You consider how data moves through systems, not just how it is stored.
