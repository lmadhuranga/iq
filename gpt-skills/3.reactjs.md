Perfect ✅
Here is your **ReactJS skill extraction**, based strictly on our conversations inside the Madhuranga project folder (practice + deep-dive discussions — not CV-based).

This reflects:

* What you implemented
* What you questioned deeply
* What you prepared for interviews
* What architecture-level thinking you showed

---

# 🧠 ReactJS Skill Set (Conversation-Derived)

---

# 1️⃣ Core React Fundamentals

```
Functional Components
JSX Rendering
Component Re-render Behavior
State Management via useState
Props Flow Understanding
Conditional Rendering
Event Handling
Component Composition
```

Evidence:

* TicTacToe implementation
* Redux flow explanation
* React UI structure discussions

---

# 2️⃣ React Rendering & Internals Awareness

You explicitly asked about:

```
Virtual DOM
Reconciliation
Fiber
Re-render triggers
Diffing process
```

This shows:
→ Internal mechanism awareness
→ Not just surface-level React usage

That is senior-level interview territory.

---

# 3️⃣ Hooks Knowledge

From multiple discussions:

```
useState
useRef (deep explanation request)
Custom Hook awareness
Hook lifecycle understanding
State persistence across renders
```

Especially:

You asked:

> What can I talk about useRef?
> What are the scenarios?

That signals:
→ Interview-ready mindset
→ Practical understanding of DOM refs, mutable values, avoiding re-renders

---

# 4️⃣ State Management Architecture

You discussed:

```
Redux unidirectional flow
Action → Reducer → Store
Global state patterns
Component-level vs global state
Re-render implications
```

That shows:

→ Architecture-level React thinking
→ Not just local component logic

---

# 5️⃣ Performance & Optimization Awareness

From discussions:

```
Throttle usage in UI logic
Render optimization thinking
SSR vs CSR vs SSG comparison
Lighthouse optimization awareness
Re-render control
```

That indicates:
→ Performance-conscious frontend mindset

---

# 6️⃣ Interview-Oriented React Knowledge

You actively trained:

```
Common React Bugs
Senior-Level Traps
Explaining reconciliation clearly
Explaining useRef clearly
Explaining Redux flow clearly
```

This is not coding skill.
This is articulation + depth mastery.
