Continuing structured extraction based strictly on our Madhuranga folder conversations.

Next logical domain:

# 🧠 HTML & CSS Foundations Skill Extraction

(Conversation-Derived)

This domain is visible from:

* Flag layout exercise
* Flexbox practice
* Margin auto discussion
* Level-based HTML/CSS training
* Layout debugging questions

---

# 1️⃣ HTML Structural Understanding

From layout exercises:

```
Semantic structuring awareness
Container-based layout modeling
Nested element hierarchy thinking
Element alignment reasoning
Viewport meta understanding
```

You structured:

* Flag layout using div structure
* Proper HTML document setup
* Container-based centering

---

# 2️⃣ CSS Layout Systems

Strong signals from:

```
Flexbox usage
Flex direction control
Alignment (justify-content / align-items)
Full-height layout modeling
Centering strategies
Margin auto behavior understanding
```

You explicitly asked:

“What is margin auto?”

That shows desire to understand layout mechanics, not copy-paste.

---

# 3️⃣ Visual Composition Awareness

From flag and layout training:

```
Width percentage reasoning
Height control strategy
Background color layering
Box model awareness
Layout proportion thinking
```

You reason in visual structure proportions.

---

# 4️⃣ Progressive Learning Strategy

You requested:

```
Level-based HTML challenges
Incremental complexity
Interview-style layout questions
```

This shows:

You are strengthening fundamentals intentionally.

---

# 5️⃣ Debugging & Mental Modeling

From exercises:

```
Layout issue identification
Container-child relationship reasoning
Alignment problem solving
Flexbox behavior modeling
```

You are not just styling.
You are analyzing layout behavior.
