Good. I’ll continue the structured extraction.

Based strictly on our conversations in the Madhuranga project folder, the next logical domain after React is:

# 🧠 Node.js Skill Extraction (Conversation-Derived)

This reflects:

* Backend architecture discussions
* Event-driven thinking
* API structure awareness
* System design conversations
* Kafka & async messaging references

Not CV-based. Conversation-based.

---

# 1️⃣ Core Node.js Fundamentals

```
Node.js runtime awareness
Event-driven architecture thinking
Asynchronous execution mindset
REST API structure understanding
Middleware concept awareness
```

Signals:

* API integration discussions
* Backend + frontend flow reasoning
* Unidirectional data flow modeling
* Async behavior via throttle discussion (JS runtime awareness)

---

# 2️⃣ Backend Architecture Thinking

From system-level discussions:

```
Microservices architecture
Modular backend structure
Separation of concerns
Layered architecture thinking
Controller → Service → Repository mental model
Multi-client architecture awareness
```

This shows backend structural reasoning, not just route writing.

---

# 3️⃣ API Design Awareness

```
RESTful design principles
Client-server communication modeling
Data contract thinking
Structured JSON responses
Middleware pipeline awareness
```

You consistently think in structured contracts.

---

# 4️⃣ Asynchronous & Messaging Concepts

From Kafka and async messaging discussions:

```
Event-driven systems
Asynchronous processing
Message broker awareness
Decoupled service communication
Transaction reliability thinking
```

This is strong backend maturity signal.

---

# 5️⃣ Performance & Scalability Awareness

```
Backend scalability mindset
API performance consideration
Separation of sync vs async workloads
Architecture for growth
```

You think beyond:

“Does it work?”

You think:

“Will it scale?”

# 🔥 Clean LLM Import Format (Node.js Only)

```json

  }
}
```

# 📊 Realistic Assessment (From Folder Only)

You show:

* Strong architectural awareness
* Event-driven mental model
* Backend system reasoning
* Not just route-level coding

What is not deeply demonstrated in folder:

* Low-level Node internals (streams, cluster, worker threads)
* Event loop phase breakdown
* Memory profiling
* Security hardening specifics

---

If you want next domain, choose:

* NestJS extraction
* System Design extraction
* AI / LLM extraction
* Database skill extraction
* Architecture meta-skill extraction

Tell me the next.
