Perfect ✅
Based strictly on **our conversations inside the Madhuranga folder**, here is your **JavaScript skill set extraction** (practice + discussion based, not CV-based).

This reflects:

* What you implemented
* What you asked deeply about
* What you debugged
* What you trained for interviews

---

# 🧠 JavaScript Skill Set (Conversation-Derived)

## 1️⃣ Core Language Fundamentals

```
Variables (let / const scope behavior)
Closures
Lexical scope
Higher-order functions
Arrow functions
Spread operator
Destructuring
Array methods
Date.now usage
Class syntax
Constructor behavior
ES6+ syntax
```

Evidence:

* throttle implementation
* closure counter example
* class vs function comparison
* incremental function execution

---

## 2️⃣ Execution Model & Behavior

```
Function execution context
State persistence via closure
this behavior (class vs function context)
Instance creation with new
Event loop understanding (implicit via throttle logic)
```

You explored:

* Why closure retains counter
* Why constructor behaves differently
* How function memory persists

---

## 3️⃣ Functional Patterns

```
Throttle implementation
Rate limiting logic
Function wrapping
Argument forwarding (...args)
Stateful function factories
```

You implemented:

```js
function throttle(fn, delay) {
  let lastCall = 0;

  return (...args) => {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastCall >= delay) {
      lastCall = now;
      fn(...args);
    }
  };
}
```

This demonstrates:

* Closure state tracking
* Functional composition
* Time-based control flow

---

## 4️⃣ Object-Oriented JavaScript

```
Class syntax
Constructor logic
Method definitions
Prototype-based behavior (implicitly)
Instance creation
```

From:

```js
class Outer {
  constructor() {
    console.log('init')
  }

  hello() {}
}
```

You were comparing:

* Function factory vs class instance model

---

## 5️⃣ React-Connected JavaScript Knowledge

```
Virtual DOM concept
Reconciliation process
Fiber understanding
State updates triggering re-render
Redux unidirectional data flow
```

This is JS runtime + architecture-level knowledge.

---

## 6️⃣ Asynchronous & Flow Awareness

Indirect but clear signals:

```
Event-driven thinking
Time-based execution control
Dispatch → Reducer → Store flow modeling
Functional state updates
```

# 📊 Realistic Level Assessment (From Folder Only)

You are:

**Strong in applied JavaScript patterns**
**Good in runtime behavior understanding**
**Actively improving system-level reasoning**

Not beginner.
Not just framework user.
You understand underlying JS mechanics.

---

If you want next:

* TypeScript skill extraction
* Advanced JS gap analysis
* Senior-level JS interview readiness score
* Weak-area detection based on conversation patterns

Tell me which direction.
