JavaScript Event Loop: How it Works and Why it Matters in 5 Minutes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqLSNG_79lI&ab_channel=JamesQQuick

```javascript
let flag = true;

setTimeout(() => {
  flag = false;
});

while (flag) {
  console.log('hello');
}
```

In this code, the `while` loop runs synchronously without giving a chance for the `setTimeout` callback to execute, as it is blocking the event loop. This will result in an infinite loop printing "hello" continuously, and the `setTimeout` callback will never have the opportunity to set `flag` to `false`.


 ---
 
1. `let flag = true;`: The variable `flag` is initialized with the value `true`.

2. `setTimeout(() => { flag = false; })`: A `setTimeout` function is called with an arrow function. The `setTimeout` function schedules its callback to be executed asynchronously after a minimum delay. However, the callback won't be executed immediately; it will be queued to the message queue when the specified time (delay) elapses.

3. `while (flag) { console.log('hello'); }`: This is a `while` loop that runs as long as the `flag` variable is `true`. Inside the loop, it prints "hello" to the console.

Now, here's the flow of execution:

1. The `flag` is initially `true`.
2. The `setTimeout` is called, scheduling the callback function to be executed asynchronously. However, the `while` loop continues running immediately without waiting for the callback to execute.
3. Since the `flag` is still `true`, the `while` loop continues to execute, and it keeps printing "hello" to the console indefinitely.
4. The callback scheduled by `setTimeout` is in the message queue but doesn't get executed yet because the call stack is busy with the `while` loop.

The issue here is that the `while` loop runs synchronously and never gives the event loop a chance to process other tasks, including the callback from `setTimeout`. As a result, the value of `flag` remains `true`, and the loop keeps running indefinitely without letting the callback set `flag` to `false`.

To avoid such infinite loops in real-world scenarios, it's essential to handle asynchronous code properly and not block the event loop with long-running synchronous operations. One way to address this would be to use callbacks, Promises, or `async/await` to properly handle asynchronous operations and ensure that the event loop can handle other tasks while waiting for asynchronous results.
