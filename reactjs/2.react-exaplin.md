## React Redux Example

This is a basic example of how to integrate React and Redux together to build a simple counter application. Below, you'll find a step-by-step guide explaining how to set up the project and implement the necessary components.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) should be installed on your machine.

### Setup

1. Create a new React project using `create-react-app`:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app react-redux-counter
   cd react-redux-counter
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install redux react-redux
   ```

### Folder Structure

```
react-redux-counter/
  src/
    components/
      Counter.js
    actions/
      counterActions.js
    reducers/
      counterReducer.js
    App.js
    index.js
```

### Implementation

1. Create a new file named `Counter.js` inside the `components` folder and add the following code:

   ```javascript
   // Counter.js

   import React from 'react';

   const Counter = ({ count, increment, decrement }) => {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
         <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
         <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default Counter;
   ```

2. Create a new file named `counterActions.js` inside the `actions` folder and add the following code:

   ```javascript
   // counterActions.js

   export const increment = () => {
     return {
       type: 'INCREMENT',
     };
   };

   export const decrement = () => {
     return {
       type: 'DECREMENT',
     };
   };
   ```

3. Create a new file named `counterReducer.js` inside the `reducers` folder and add the following code:

   ```javascript
   // counterReducer.js

   const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
     switch (action.type) {
       case 'INCREMENT':
         return state + 1;
       case 'DECREMENT':
         return state - 1;
       default:
         return state;
     }
   };

   export default counterReducer;
   ```

4. Open the `App.js` file and replace its content with the following code:

   ```javascript
   // App.js

   import React from 'react';
   import { connect } from 'react-redux';
   import { increment, decrement } from './actions/counterActions';
   import Counter from './components/Counter';

   const App = ({ count, increment, decrement }) => {
     return <Counter count={count} increment={increment} decrement={decrement} />;
   };

   const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
     return {
       count: state,
     };
   };

   export default connect(mapStateToProps, { increment, decrement })(App);
   ```

5. Open the `index.js` file and replace its content with the following code:

   ```javascript
   // index.js

   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
   import { createStore } from 'redux';
   import counterReducer from './reducers/counterReducer';
   import App from './App';

   const store = createStore(counterReducer);

   ReactDOM.render(
     <Provider store={store}>
       <App />
     </Provider>,
     document.getElementById('root')
   );
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server and see the counter application in action, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the counter. You can click the "Increment" and "Decrement" buttons to change the counter value.

This example demonstrates the basic integration of React and Redux, allowing you to manage the state of a counter using Redux. From here, you can expand upon this foundation to build more complex applications with Redux for state management.
